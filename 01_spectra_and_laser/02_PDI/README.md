## We will repeat the workflow used for the carbazole molecule with a new molecule, PDI.

1) Based on the calculations that you ran under `01_spectra_and_laser/01_carbazole/01_spectrum/`:

  a) Create a proper folder and copy the coordinates to calculate the spectrum
  b) Calculate the absorption spectrum with a proper `dftb_in.hsd` input file
  c) Find the lowest energy transition

2) Based on the calculations that you ran under `01_spectra_and_laser/01_carbazole/02_laser_and_analysis/`:

  a) Study the excitation process using a laser tuned with the transition
  b) Obtain the orbitals involved in the transition using waveplot and plot them
